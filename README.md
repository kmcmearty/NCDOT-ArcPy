# NCDOT-ArcPy

A script created during my time as a North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) contractor in the Roads and Highways Division. The script extracts NC Route shapefile data in ArcGIS into a .csv file which was then used to update an internal SAP database. The script sorts through +300,000 NC Route Records and outputs a list that met specific requirements. The .csv file was then fed into an internal NCDOT SAP database in order to provide up-to-date data for the field crews. 


The NCRoutes_SHP file data is made publicly available by the North Carolina Department of Transportation for anyone to download at: https://connect.ncdot.gov/resources/gis/Pages/GIS-Data-Layers.aspx
